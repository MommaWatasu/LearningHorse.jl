=======
LearningHorse is Julia's machine learning library.At the moment, the algorithms that can be used are limited and unstable,
but we will continue to develop them.

## Resources
- Documentation:https://ik1-414-39231.vs.sakura.ne.jp/learninghorse/
- Souce code:https://github.com/QGMW22/Learninghorse.jl

## Installation
LearningHorse can be installed using the Julia package manager.
From the Julia REPL, type ] to enter the Pkg REPL mode and run.
```@example
pkg > add LearningHorse
```

## Improvement
Next, we plan to implement classification.
